# SARS chatbot

The pandemic due to COVID-19 has collapsed HealthCare in many countries. Citizens' doubts regarding symptoms and procedures is another aspect that contributes to the saturation of the HealthCare System. This is why solutions have been sought for example with online applications or web pages that alleviate the workload of official communication channels.

In our project we propose the development and training of a chatbot that helps the population to solve common doubts that alleviate the mentioned workload. Using public datasets and machine learning training that will be carried out by our team, we will develop a chatbot that, among other things, helps with diagnosis, solves general doubts and returns up to date recommendations.
